### WELCOME ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student and i am learning web development.
Always looking for opportunities and interesting projects to work on.
I use Python and django, javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL. I'm also ready to learn something new and always open to new languages and frameworks. As i told you, i'm new at this.
I hope you'll enjoy what you find here. Don't hesitate to give advice ;)
Thank you for your interest.
