### WELCOME ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior developper.
Always looking for opportunities and interesting projects to work on.
I use Python, FastAPI, React.js, Docker, and Typescript. I'm also ready to learn something new and always open to new languages and frameworks.
I hope you'll enjoy what you find here. Don't hesitate to give advice ;)
Thank you for your interest.
